# Resize Card: Obsidian Plugin

Resize Card Plugin is an Obsidian Canvas plugin that lets you quickly resize canvas nodes using hotkeys. Cycle through a list of preset sizes or apply a fixed size with a single command. The plugin also provides a settings tab so you can customize the preset sizes to suit your workflow. It updates the underlying canvas node data using Obsidian's internal API (via `node.setData()`), ensuring that changes persist even when the canvas re-renders.

## Features

- **Cycle Sizes:**  
  Use <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> to cycle through preset sizes for the currently selected canvas node. The default cycle (in order) is:  
  - 250px × 240px  
  - 600px × 800px  
  - 400px × 400px  

- **Fixed Size:**  
  Use <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> to set the selected node to a fixed size. The default fixed size is:  
  - 600px × 400px

- **Customizable Settings:**  
  Easily adjust the preset cycle sizes and fixed size through the plugin’s settings tab.

- **Persistent Updates:**  
  The plugin updates the underlying canvas node data using the internal API, ensuring that your changes persist on re-render.

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository** into your vault's plugins directory:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/vault/.obsidian/plugins
   git clone https://github.com/jasperyzh/obsidian-resize-card-plugin.git
   ```
2. Open Obsidian and go to **Settings > Community Plugins**.
3. Disable Safe Mode if necessary.
4. Click **Reload Plugins**.
5. Find and enable the **Resize Card Plugin**.

## Usage

- **Cycle Through Preset Sizes:**  
  Select a node in your Canvas view and press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> to cycle through the preset sizes.

- **Apply Fixed Size:**  
  With a node selected, press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> to resize it to the fixed dimensions.

## Plugin Settings

To customize the preset sizes:

1. Go to **Settings > Community Plugins > Resize Card Plugin Settings**.
2. Edit the **Cycle Sizes** field. The default value is:
   ```json
   [
     { "width": 250, "height": 240 },
     { "width": 600, "height": 800 },
     { "width": 400, "height": 400 }
   ]
   ```
3. Edit the **Fixed Size** field. The default value is:
   ```json
   { "width": 600, "height": 400 }
   ```
4. Save your changes. The plugin will use these values the next time you invoke the commands.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).

### Build Instructions

This plugin is built using TypeScript and bundled with esbuild. For development, you can use watch mode to automatically rebuild the plugin when changes are made.

1. Clone the repository into your vault’s plugins folder.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Development Build with Watch Mode:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This command uses the `src/build.js` script (which utilizes esbuild's context API) to bundle your TypeScript source from `src/main.ts` into `main.js` in the plugin root. It will remain active and watch for changes.
4. Reload your plugin from Obsidian (or restart Obsidian) to see your changes.

```

### npm Scripts

- **Build:**  
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
  This will run a one‑time build that bundles your code to `main.js`.

- **Dev (Watch Mode):**  
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
  This will run the build script in watch mode, automatically rebuilding on file changes.
